I finally got serious about wanting to,0.48,4.56
change my life a few years ago so I did,2.76,4.619
my research I found the ultimate side,5.04,4.38
Hustle by watching hundreds of hours of,7.379,3.901
YouTube videos and picking the one that,9.42,3.96
was right for me and after working just,11.28,4.859
four hours a week for two months I'm now,13.38,4.92
a multi-millionaire,16.139,4.441
yeah right if you believe that I have a,18.3,3.899
bridge to sell you too,20.58,4.08
here's the truth watching videos about,22.199,4.801
side hustles is just taking you down the,24.66,3.779
rabbit hole you'll find yourself,27.0,3.72
clicking on one video after another in,28.439,3.66
hopes of finding a good way to make,30.72,3.839
money but after hours of wandering about,32.099,5.521
you'll end up lost overwhelmed and,34.559,4.561
Confused,37.62,3.48
I'm here to tell you that for someone,39.12,4.14
who actually really wants to change,41.1,4.02
their life for the better side hustles,43.26,4.56
are not the way to go side hustles are a,45.12,5.279
distraction an attempt at a quick fix a,47.82,4.2
little bit of easy money,50.399,3.961
but your time and energy is limited by,52.02,4.859
filling up any free time you have with,54.36,4.859
extra work of some kind that just pays a,56.879,4.261
small amount you stay on a hamster wheel,59.219,5.221
always running just trying to keep up,61.14,4.86
I propose that you do something,64.44,4.92
different instead of aiming low Aim High,66.0,5.159
follow the four steps that we will,69.36,3.9
discuss in this video to use your free,71.159,4.201
time to build a business that can change,73.26,4.26
your life instead of pursuing a side gig,75.36,4.079
that will just be a small supplement to,77.52,3.779
your main job that keeps you on the,79.439,3.72
hamster wheel,81.299,3.721
after earning an MBA at Cornell,83.159,3.721
University I spent my career building,85.02,3.54
venture capital and private Equity,86.88,3.779
backed companies I've served as the,88.56,3.84
Chief Financial Officer of several,90.659,3.481
software businesses where I worked,92.4,3.719
closely with sales marketing and,94.14,3.78
operations to grow the company,96.119,3.721
I tell you this so you know that what,97.92,4.86
I'm sharing today comes from experience,99.84,5.22
so here's the secret to starting a,102.78,4.44
successful business actually it's not,105.06,3.78
really a secret at all but it gets,107.22,3.24
drowned out amidst all the noise and,108.84,3.3
distractions on YouTube from countless,110.46,3.839
how to make money videos,112.14,4.799
the truth is finding success in business,114.299,4.561
comes down to this one simple formula,116.939,5.161
write it down and always keep it in mind,118.86,6.899
you need to one identify a problem,122.1,7.859
two solve the problem three get paid,125.759,7.081
for refine and repeat,129.959,4.5
let's walk through this in a little more,132.84,3.84
detail with some great examples of how,134.459,4.441
regular people build thriving businesses,136.68,4.199
by following this formula,138.9,4.26
the formula starts with number one being,140.879,4.381
identify a problem but actually there's,143.16,4.32
a vital step before number one and that,145.26,4.76
is to tell yourself get started already,147.48,5.46
stop talking about wanting to start a,150.02,5.64
business stop endlessly watching videos,152.94,5.7
scrolling for ideas stop coming up with,155.66,5.74
reasons why you can't start yet why now,158.64,5.16
is not a good time why I'll start just,161.4,4.619
as soon as something whatever I'm,163.8,4.26
waiting for to get out of the way,166.019,3.8
just get started,168.06,4.52
procrastination is a success killer,169.819,5.621
procrastination is negative momentum and,172.58,5.68
what you need is positive momentum once,175.44,5.1
you start moving it's so much easier to,178.26,6.3
keep moving so start moving get started,180.54,5.1
good,184.56,2.7
now that you're moving here's what,185.64,4.379
you're going to do first identify a,187.26,4.74
problem the world is full of problems,190.019,3.961
you come across problems in your daily,192.0,4.62
life the key is to note them write them,193.98,4.979
down literally sit down and make a list,196.62,4.92
don't just wait for inspiration to serve,198.959,4.321
up the perfect business idea in a dream,201.54,4.02
because that may never happen,203.28,4.08
think of the problems you've come across,205.56,3.72
in your life think of things in your,207.36,3.959
hobbies or your work that were hard to,209.28,4.679
do or hard to figure out then think,211.319,4.441
about what a solution to those problems,213.959,2.881
might be,215.76,3.36
if you can solve these problems you have,216.84,3.72
a potential business,219.12,3.96
every business involves someone getting,220.56,4.94
paid to solve a problem for example,223.08,4.68
entertainment businesses can be thought,225.5,4.36
of as solving any number of problems or,227.76,4.94
needs such as boredom loneliness,229.86,6.0
distraction inspiration providing an,232.7,5.86
escape or relaxation Etc a health or,235.86,5.34
Wellness business like a doctor a health,238.56,5.7
author or a fitness YouTuber helps solve,241.2,4.8
all sorts of problems or needs with,244.26,4.08
information and inspiration and support,246.0,4.62
to help people improve their health,248.34,5.34
a tax accountant solves the problems of,250.62,5.459
tax preparation being complicated scary,253.68,4.679
or time consuming for many people,256.079,4.681
so think back what problems have you,258.359,4.56
encountered that you solved or could,260.76,4.2
solve what things have you learned how,262.919,4.321
to do that could form the basis for a,264.96,3.48
product,267.24,3.06
a woman who I used to work with in New,268.44,3.479
York City was from China,270.3,3.3
she was interested in traditional,271.919,4.021
Chinese tea but even though we lived in,273.6,3.72
New York City with its thriving,275.94,3.84
Chinatown she wasn't satisfied with the,277.32,4.14
tea choices available,279.78,4.02
she decided to solve this problem and,281.46,4.32
started an online tea business called,283.8,4.86
tea drunk where she sells premium teas,285.78,5.1
imported from China promotes and,288.66,3.96
celebrates traditional Chinese tea,290.88,4.259
culture and offers free and paid classes,292.62,5.46
about tea for The Connoisseur she's,295.139,6.661
created a thriving business around t a,298.08,5.399
business does not have to be complicated,301.8,3.54
to do well,303.479,4.141
whatever problems and solutions you come,305.34,4.799
up with try to estimate how big the,307.62,4.5
potential Market opportunity is try to,310.139,4.441
answer the questions how many people or,312.12,4.92
businesses have this problem and how,314.58,4.679
much might they pay for a solution,317.04,4.32
when asking these questions you are,319.259,3.601
following the lead of some of the best,321.36,3.42
investors and startup companies The,322.86,4.02
Venture Capital investors they always,324.78,4.8
want to know what problem do you solve,326.88,5.64
and how big is the market opportunity,329.58,4.98
if you borrow this approach it can help,332.52,3.66
you choose which of several different,334.56,3.6
business ideas might be most attractive,336.18,3.359
to pursue,338.16,3.3
to give you further ideas of problems,339.539,3.781
you might find and to illustrate that it,341.46,3.72
can be simple things here are some,343.32,3.599
problems I've come across recently in my,345.18,2.82
life,346.919,3.661
my wife wanted to raise chickens we live,348.0,4.139
in a country environment that gets,350.58,3.54
really cold in the winter we knew,352.139,4.5
nothing about raising chickens or about,354.12,5.04
how to keep them safe in the cold so to,356.639,3.961
answer the countless questions we had,359.16,3.3
about how to do it we scoured the,360.6,4.68
internet and YouTube looking for advice,362.46,5.519
I would have gladly paid for a course on,365.28,5.04
raising chickens or a support resource,367.979,4.741
of some kind it would have saved us so,370.32,3.54
much time,372.72,3.419
same thing with bees she wanted to raise,373.86,4.44
honeybees but again it was not a good,376.139,3.9
resource available or at least not that,378.3,2.64
we found,380.039,2.761
we would have gladly paid for a course,380.94,3.96
or help,382.8,4.26
or food for thought if you work in a,384.9,4.139
business what doesn't work well there,387.06,4.139
what slows things down or causes,389.039,4.321
problems or something that could be done,391.199,4.741
a lot better faster or cheaper,393.36,5.16
can you solve any of them is this a,395.94,5.039
problem that other companies have too,398.52,4.98
solving these problems are all potential,400.979,4.381
businesses,403.5,3.84
speaking of problems I'm having a small,405.36,4.679
problem right now I can't quite reach,407.34,5.4
the like button on your screen could you,410.039,4.621
do me a favor and just,412.74,4.32
push the like button if you're enjoying,414.66,4.2
the video I don't really understand it,417.06,4.139
but I heard a rumor that this somehow,418.86,3.839
tells Google that this is a good video,421.199,3.84
to share I don't know,422.699,4.381
and if you want more of this kind of,425.039,4.021
content from me go ahead and subscribe,427.08,3.179
too,429.06,2.94
thanks very much,430.259,4.38
back to our list number two,432.0,4.38
once you've identified some problems,434.639,3.241
that you could solve that you believe,436.38,3.48
have a big enough market opportunity to,437.88,4.259
be worth your while think about how you,439.86,4.44
could solve them for someone is it,442.139,3.421
something that you would teach other,444.3,3.6
people how to do themselves or a service,445.56,4.8
that you would do for them or something,447.9,5.46
that you would make and sell decide how,450.36,4.92
you will solve the problem,453.36,4.44
okay now listen carefully to what I'm,455.28,4.199
about to tell you this is a very,457.8,4.56
important point you should not spend a,459.479,5.28
ton of time trying to design the perfect,462.36,5.22
solution you can't because you don't,464.759,4.681
know yet the extent of the customer's,467.58,4.019
problem or what the perfect product is,469.44,4.979
you have an idea but you haven't tested,471.599,4.32
it yet in the market,474.419,3.601
so put together what you think is the,475.919,4.741
minimum viable product known as the MVP,478.02,5.22
the smallest and or simplest product,480.66,4.86
needed to solve the problem is you,483.24,4.32
envision it and to get sales,485.52,4.14
this is what you bring to market sell,487.56,4.259
them this product first and then listen,489.66,4.5
to your customers to get feedback,491.819,4.261
with the feedback you can evolve the,494.16,3.599
product and make it better,496.08,3.839
this method is explained brilliantly in,497.759,4.021
a book called The Lean Startup which,499.919,3.301
I'll link to in the description under,501.78,3.84
the video I highly recommend this book,503.22,4.259
for all entrepreneurs and anyone,505.62,3.84
thinking of starting a business it will,507.479,4.261
literally make you smarter by showing,509.46,4.079
you how to think about building and,511.74,3.539
evolving a product to fit your Market,513.539,4.201
Kelly and Daniel are health and fitness,515.279,4.981
Buffs they enjoyed everything about,517.74,4.62
eating right and a good exercise routine,520.26,3.899
but when they look for videos on YouTube,522.36,4.979
on these topics they found it lacking so,524.159,5.101
they started a YouTube channel to fill,527.339,2.881
the gap,529.26,3.42
their videos were not fancy just basic,530.22,4.619
the videos showed Kelly and Daniel,532.68,4.38
working out together and coaching the,534.839,4.44
viewers through the routine so viewers,537.06,4.86
could work out with them a classic MVP,539.279,5.881
well guess what people love them,541.92,5.52
their Channel and business named Fitness,545.16,5.28
Blender has been wildly successful with,547.44,6.24
6.7 million subscribers on YouTube with,550.44,5.7
loads of free videos plus a website,553.68,4.5
where you can buy premium content and,556.14,3.18
tools,558.18,3.96
start with the MVP and evolve it if and,559.32,5.88
when necessary three you need to get,562.14,5.819
paid for providing the solution estimate,565.2,5.16
how much it will cost you to do or to,567.959,4.56
make include all of your time and costs,570.36,4.44
then decide how much you will charge for,572.519,3.361
the solution,574.8,3.06
you can set your price by doing market,575.88,3.72
research to see how much other people,577.86,4.62
charge for similar services or set the,579.6,4.919
price equal to your Cost Plus a markup,582.48,3.24
for profit,584.519,3.721
to be profitable obviously your selling,585.72,4.44
price needs to be higher than your cost,588.24,4.44
be mindful though that depending on what,590.16,3.66
you're selling,592.68,2.88
it might be difficult to determine the,593.82,3.66
right price because it's not clear yet,595.56,3.719
how valuable your product is to the,597.48,4.38
market or what your cost will be,599.279,4.62
at this stage particularly before you,601.86,3.9
launch a service based product there,603.899,4.38
simply may be too many unknowns you may,605.76,4.259
not know for sure how much it will cost,608.279,3.421
you to provide the product or solution,610.019,3.781
because you may not know how much time,611.7,4.74
it will take you to do the work involved,613.8,4.68
you also won't know if the product is,616.44,3.899
right for the market or if it needs a,618.48,3.6
lot of changes which could change the,620.339,4.201
cost and you don't know yet how much,622.08,4.98
value it provides to your customers,624.54,4.62
so at this point I just aim to set a,627.06,4.26
price that covers all my estimated costs,629.16,4.08
including a reasonable wage for my time,631.32,4.079
making sure to protect myself should,633.24,4.2
cost be higher than expected and just,635.399,3.781
try to make some sales,637.44,3.959
the product and pricing can be refined,639.18,2.94
later,641.399,2.88
the purpose of the early stages of all,642.12,5.159
this are to test the product and learn,644.279,5.521
John Lee Dumas used to drive to work,647.279,4.68
listening to podcasts but he got,649.8,3.9
frustrated that the ones he liked only,651.959,4.081
came out with maybe one episode per week,653.7,3.72
he really wished they were available,656.04,2.88
more often,657.42,3.479
then John realized that he could create,658.92,4.32
the solution himself that he wished was,660.899,3.361
available,663.24,3.539
so John launched his podcast called,664.26,5.4
entrepreneur on fire publishing one new,666.779,4.5
episode every day,669.66,3.96
John's Focus initially was not Revenue,671.279,4.101
it was on building a good product,673.62,4.74
granted his cost consisted mostly of his,675.38,5.139
own time but still he was basically,678.36,4.08
working for free initially to get the,680.519,3.901
product up and running and in the hands,682.44,4.2
of customers his listeners,684.42,5.52
well John's podcast was a big hit with,686.64,5.639
now over 100 million listens to his,689.94,5.04
episodes before long he noticed that,692.279,4.56
some of his listeners were asking him,694.98,3.72
lots of questions about the steps,696.839,4.081
involved in making a podcast,698.7,4.02
this is where he refined his product,700.92,3.96
offering because his customers were,702.72,4.44
telling him they wanted something more,704.88,5.28
in response he created an in-depth,707.16,5.58
online resource to teach people all the,710.16,5.16
steps involved in launching a podcast,712.74,5.4
this podcasting course was also a huge,715.32,5.04
success John has now run these,718.14,4.62
businesses for over a decade and made,720.36,5.099
many many millions of dollars from them,722.76,5.22
this brings us to step four refine and,725.459,4.44
repeat this is where you work on the,727.98,3.72
stuff that can make you rich you've,729.899,3.721
identified a product idea to solve a,731.7,3.66
problem for someone you've built a,733.62,3.899
minimum viable product and got it into,735.36,4.62
the hands of initial customers up until,737.519,4.44
now production of the product may be,739.98,4.44
pretty manual and inefficient as you,741.959,4.081
work with initial customers or get,744.42,3.0
feedback from them if they bought a,746.04,3.359
finished product learn from them and,747.42,3.359
make the product better,749.399,3.241
then you'll sell and deliver the better,750.779,4.981
product over time you keep learning keep,752.64,5.46
selling and keep making it better,755.76,5.1
also start thinking about how to scale,758.1,4.799
up your production about how you can,760.86,4.56
make it faster and easier to produce and,762.899,5.161
maybe even less expensive to make you'll,765.42,4.08
also learn better what the value,768.06,3.66
proposition is to your customer which,769.5,3.66
will help you in your sales and,771.72,4.2
marketing and in setting a better price,773.16,4.859
this stage is where you start to make,775.92,4.32
your business into a factory where you,778.019,4.5
produce more better cheaper,780.24,3.96
it's in the scaling of your business,782.519,4.141
where you start to leverage things other,784.2,5.639
people processes software and Machinery,786.66,4.619
depending on the nature of your business,789.839,4.081
which can help it to become wonderfully,791.279,4.68
profitable,793.92,4.919
once again the steps are,795.959,6.541
identify a problem solve the problem get,798.839,6.721
paid refine and repeat,802.5,5.579
there are countless examples of regular,805.56,4.86
people building great businesses they're,808.079,4.921
no better than you are no smarter no,810.42,4.82
luckier they just found a problem,813.0,6.36
identified a solution and took action if,815.24,5.32
you really want to change your life,819.36,3.96
don't waste time on side hustles work on,820.56,4.68
identifying a problem and then create,823.32,3.48
the solution,825.24,4.62
so get started now,826.8,6.2
I'll see you in the next one,829.86,3.14
