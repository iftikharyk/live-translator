1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,760
I finally got serious about wanting to

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,040
change my life a few years ago so I did

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,379
my research I found the ultimate side

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,420
Hustle by watching hundreds of hours of

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,280
YouTube videos and picking the one that

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,380
was right for me and after working just

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,139
four hours a week for two months I'm now

8
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,300
a multi-millionaire

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,580
yeah right if you believe that I have a

10
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,199
bridge to sell you too

11
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,660
here's the truth watching videos about

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,000
side hustles is just taking you down the

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,439
rabbit hole you'll find yourself

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,720
clicking on one video after another in

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,099
hopes of finding a good way to make

16
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:34,559
money but after hours of wandering about

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,620
you'll end up lost overwhelmed and

18
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,120
Confused

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,100
I'm here to tell you that for someone

20
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,260
who actually really wants to change

21
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,120
their life for the better side hustles

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,820
are not the way to go side hustles are a

23
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,399
distraction an attempt at a quick fix a

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,020
little bit of easy money

25
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,360
but your time and energy is limited by

26
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,879
filling up any free time you have with

27
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,219
extra work of some kind that just pays a

28
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,140
small amount you stay on a hamster wheel

29
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,440
always running just trying to keep up

30
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,000
I propose that you do something

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,360
different instead of aiming low Aim High

32
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,159
follow the four steps that we will

33
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,260

34
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,360
time to build a business that can change

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,520
your life instead of pursuing a side gig

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,439
that will just be a small supplement to

37
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,299
your main job that keeps you on the

38
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,159
hamster wheel

39
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,020
after earning an MBA at Cornell

40
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,880
University I spent my career building

41
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,560
venture capital and private Equity

42
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,659
backed companies I've served as the

43
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,400
Chief Financial Officer of several

44
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,140
software businesses where I worked

45
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,119
closely with sales marketing and

46
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:37,920
operations to grow the company

47
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,840
I tell you this so you know that what

48
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,780
I'm sharing today comes from experience

49
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,060
so here's the secret to starting a

50
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,220
successful business actually it's not

51
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,840
really a secret at all but it gets

52
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,460
drowned out amidst all the noise and

53
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,140
distractions on YouTube from countless

54
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,299
how to make money videos

55
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,939
the truth is finding success in business

56
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,860
comes down to this one simple formula

57
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,100
write it down and always keep it in mind

58
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,759
you need to one identify a problem

59
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,959
two solve the problem three get paid

60
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,840
for refine and repeat

61
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,459
let's walk through this in a little more

62
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,680
detail with some great examples of how

63
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,900
regular people build thriving businesses

64
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,879
by following this formula

65
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,160
the formula starts with number one being

66
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,260
identify a problem but actually there's

67
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,480
a vital step before number one and that

68
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,020
is to tell yourself get started already

69
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,940
stop talking about wanting to start a

70
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,660
business stop endlessly watching videos

71
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,640
scrolling for ideas stop coming up with

72
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,400
reasons why you can't start yet why now

73
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,800
is not a good time why I'll start just

74
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,019
as soon as something whatever I'm

75
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,060
waiting for to get out of the way

76
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,819
just get started

77
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:52,580
procrastination is a success killer

78
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,440
procrastination is negative momentum and

79
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,260
what you need is positive momentum once

80
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,540
you start moving it's so much easier to

81
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,560
keep moving so start moving get started

82
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,640
good

83
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,260
now that you're moving here's what

84
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,019
you're going to do first identify a

85
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,000
problem the world is full of problems

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,980
you come across problems in your daily

87
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,620
life the key is to note them write them

88
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,959
down literally sit down and make a list

89
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,540
don't just wait for inspiration to serve

90
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,280
up the perfect business idea in a dream

91
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,560
because that may never happen

92
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,360
think of the problems you've come across

93
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,280
in your life think of things in your

94
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,319
hobbies or your work that were hard to

95
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,959
do or hard to figure out then think

96
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,760
about what a solution to those problems

97
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,840
might be

98
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,120
if you can solve these problems you have

99
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,560
a potential business

100
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,080
every business involves someone getting

101
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,500
paid to solve a problem for example

102
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,760
entertainment businesses can be thought

103
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,860
of as solving any number of problems or

104
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,700
needs such as boredom loneliness

105
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,860
distraction inspiration providing an

106
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,560
escape or relaxation Etc a health or

107
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,200
Wellness business like a doctor a health

108
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,260
author or a fitness YouTuber helps solve

109
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,000
all sorts of problems or needs with

110
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,340
information and inspiration and support

111
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,620
to help people improve their health

112
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,680
a tax accountant solves the problems of

113
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,079
tax preparation being complicated scary

114
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,359
or time consuming for many people

115
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,760
so think back what problems have you

116
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,919
encountered that you solved or could

117
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,960
solve what things have you learned how

118
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,240
to do that could form the basis for a

119
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,440
product

120
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,300
a woman who I used to work with in New

121
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,919
York City was from China

122
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,600
she was interested in traditional

123
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,940
Chinese tea but even though we lived in

124
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,320
New York City with its thriving

125
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,780
Chinatown she wasn't satisfied with the

126
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,460
tea choices available

127
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,800
she decided to solve this problem and

128
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,780
started an online tea business called

129
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,660
tea drunk where she sells premium teas

130
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,880
imported from China promotes and

131
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,620
celebrates traditional Chinese tea

132
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,139
culture and offers free and paid classes

businesses have this problem and how

142
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,259

can be simple things here are some

156
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,919
problems I've come across recently in my

157
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,000
life

158
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,580
my wife wanted to raise chickens we live

159
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,139
in a country environment that gets

160
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,120
really cold in the winter we knew

161
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,639
nothing about raising chickens or about

162
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,160
how to keep them safe in the cold so to

163
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,600
answer the countless questions we had

164
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,460
about how to do it we scoured the

165
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,280
internet and YouTube looking for advice

166
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,979
I would have gladly paid for a course on

167
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,320
raising chickens or a support resource

168
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,720
of some kind it would have saved us so

169
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,860
much time

170
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,139
same thing with bees she wanted to raise

171
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,300
honeybees but again it was not a good

172
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,039
resource available or at least not that

173
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:20,940
we found

174
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,800
we would have gladly paid for a course

175
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,900
or help

176
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,060
or food for thought if you work in a

177
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,039
business what doesn't work well there

178
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,199
what slows things down or causes

179
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,360
problems or something that could be done

180
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,940
a lot better faster or cheaper

181
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,520
can you solve any of them is this a

182
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,979
problem that other companies have too

183
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:43,500
solving these problems are all potential

184
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,360
businesses

191
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,199
but I heard a rumor that this somehow

192
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,699
tells Google that this is a good video

193
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,039

thanks very much

198
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,639
back to our list number two

199
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,380
once you've identified some problems

200
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,880
that you could solve that you believe

201
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,860
have a big enough market opportunity to

202
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,139
be worth your while think about how you

203
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,300
could solve them for someone is it

204
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,560
something that you would teach other

205
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,900
people how to do themselves or a service

206
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,360
that you would do for them or something

207
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,360
that you would make and sell decide how

208
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,280
you will solve the problem

209
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,800
okay now listen carefully to what I'm

210
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,479
about to tell you this is a very

211
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:42,360
important point you should not spend a

212
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,759
ton of time trying to design the perfect

213
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,580
solution you can't because you don't

214
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,440
know yet the extent of the customer's

215
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,599
problem or what the perfect product is

216
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,419
you have an idea but you haven't tested

217
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:55,919
it yet in the market

218
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,020
so put together what you think is the

219
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,660
minimum viable product known as the MVP

220
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,240
the smallest and or simplest product

221
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,520
needed to solve the problem is you

222
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,560
envision it and to get sales

223
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,660
this is what you bring to market sell

224
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,819
them this product first and then listen

225
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,160
to your customers to get feedback

226
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,080
with the feedback you can evolve the

227
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,759
product and make it better

228
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,919
this method is explained brilliantly in

229
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,780
a book called The Lean Startup which

230
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,220
I'll link to in the description under

231
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,620
the video I highly recommend this book

232
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,479
for all entrepreneurs and anyone

233
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:29,460
thinking of starting a business it will

234
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,740
literally make you smarter by showing

235
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,539
you how to think about building and

236
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,279
evolving a product to fit your Market

237
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,740
Kelly and Daniel are health and fitness

238
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,260
Buffs they enjoyed everything about

239
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,360
eating right and a good exercise routine

240
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,159
but when they look for videos on YouTube

241
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,339
on these topics they found it lacking so

242
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:49,260
they started a YouTube channel to fill

243
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,220
the gap

244
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,680
their videos were not fancy just basic

245
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,839
the videos showed Kelly and Daniel

246
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,060
working out together and coaching the

247
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,279
viewers through the routine so viewers

248
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,920
could work out with them a classic MVP

249
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,160
well guess what people love them

250
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,440
their Channel and business named Fitness

251
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,440
Blender has been wildly successful with

252
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,680
6.7 million subscribers on YouTube with

253
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,140
loads of free videos plus a website

254
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,180
where you can buy premium content and

255
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,320
tools

256
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,140
start with the MVP and evolve it if and

257
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,200
when necessary three you need to get

258
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,959
paid for providing the solution estimate

259
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:30,360
how much it will cost you to do or to

260
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,519
make include all of your time and costs

261
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,800
then decide how much you will charge for

262
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,880
the solution

263
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,860
you can set your price by doing market

264
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,600
research to see how much other people

265
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,480
charge for similar services or set the

266
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,519
price equal to your Cost Plus a markup

267
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,720
for profit

268
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,240
to be profitable obviously your selling

269
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,160
price needs to be higher than your cost

270
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,680
be mindful though that depending on what

271
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,820
you're selling

272
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,560
it might be difficult to determine the

273
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,480
right price because it's not clear yet

274
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,279
how valuable your product is to the

275
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,860
market or what your cost will be

276
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,899
at this stage particularly before you

277
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,760
launch a service based product there

278
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,279
simply may be too many unknowns you may

279
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,019
not know for sure how much it will cost

280
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:11,700
you to provide the product or solution

281
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,800
because you may not know how much time

282
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,440
it will take you to do the work involved

283
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,480
you also won't know if the product is

284
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,339
right for the market or if it needs a

285
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,080
lot of changes which could change the

286
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,540
cost and you don't know yet how much

287
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,060
value it provides to your customers

288
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,160
so at this point I just aim to set a

289
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,320
price that covers all my estimated costs

290
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,240
including a reasonable wage for my time

291
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,399
making sure to protect myself should

292
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,440
cost be higher than expected and just

293
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,180
try to make some sales

294
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,399
the product and pricing can be refined

295
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,120
later

296
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,279
the purpose of the early stages of all

297
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:47,279
this are to test the product and learn

298
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,800
John Lee Dumas used to drive to work

299
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,959
listening to podcasts but he got

300
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:53,700
frustrated that the ones he liked only

301
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,040
came out with maybe one episode per week

302
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,420
he really wished they were available

303
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,920
more often

304
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,899
then John realized that he could create

305
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,240
the solution himself that he wished was

306
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,260
available

307
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,779
so John launched his podcast called

308
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:09,660
entrepreneur on fire publishing one new

309
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,279
episode every day

310
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,620
John's Focus initially was not Revenue

311
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,380
it was on building a good product

312
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,360
granted his cost consisted mostly of his

313
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,519
own time but still he was basically

314
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,440
working for free initially to get the

315
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,420
product up and running and in the hands

316
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,640
of customers his listeners

317
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,940
well John's podcast was a big hit with

318
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,279
now over 100 million listens to his

319
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,980
episodes before long he noticed that

320
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,839
some of his listeners were asking him

321
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,700
lots of questions about the steps

322
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,920
involved in making a podcast

323
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,720
this is where he refined his product

324
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,880
offering because his customers were

325
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,160
telling him they wanted something more

326
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,160
in response he created an in-depth

327
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,740
online resource to teach people all the

328
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,320
steps involved in launching a podcast

329
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,140
this podcasting course was also a huge

330
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,360
success John has now run these

331
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,760
businesses for over a decade and made

332
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,459
many many millions of dollars from them

333
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,980
this brings us to step four refine and

334
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,899
repeat this is where you work on the

335
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:11,700
stuff that can make you rich you've

336
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,620
identified a product idea to solve a

337
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,360
problem for someone you've built a

338
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,519
minimum viable product and got it into

339
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,980
the hands of initial customers up until

340
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,959
now production of the product may be

341
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:24,420
pretty manual and inefficient as you

342
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,040
work with initial customers or get

343
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,420
feedback from them if they bought a

344
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,399
finished product learn from them and

345
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,779
make the product better

346
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:32,640
then you'll sell and deliver the better

347
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,760
product over time you keep learning keep

348
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,100
selling and keep making it better

349
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,860
also start thinking about how to scale

350
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,899
up your production about how you can

351
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,420
make it faster and easier to produce and

352
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,060
maybe even less expensive to make you'll

353
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,500
also learn better what the value

354
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,720
proposition is to your customer which

355
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,160
will help you in your sales and

356
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,920
marketing and in setting a better price

357
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,019
this stage is where you start to make

358
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:00,240
your business into a factory where you

359
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,519
produce more better cheaper

360
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,200
it's in the scaling of your business

361
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,660
where you start to leverage things other

362
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,839
people processes software and Machinery

363
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,279
depending on the nature of your business

364
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,920
which can help it to become wonderfully

365
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,959
profitable

366
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,839
once again the steps are

367
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,500
identify a problem solve the problem get

368
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,560
paid refine and repeat

369
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,079
there are countless examples of regular

370
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,420
people building great businesses they're

371
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,000
no better than you are no smarter no

372
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,240
luckier they just found a problem

373
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,360
identified a solution and took action if

374
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,560
you really want to change your life

375
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,320
